Id like some unit tests created we i can validate the major features of the program. 1. launching the ml app, 2. launching the ffmpeg process (if possible without a camera attached), 3. simuluating a movement response from the camera, testing the frame extraction and motion detection, we can provide a extract from the real system maybe and store it in the repo under a test data folder, if you can help me to that (video files in /home/kehowli/video). and 4. ensure the movement record is updated, the objects are detected, ffmpeg closes successfullly and the movemetn is complete.
